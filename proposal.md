# Fishing In Space!

CF1 - Example Project Proposal

## Theme: Idler Fishing Game

Video games often have 'mini games' within them, and my own anecdotal observations tell me that fishing is extremely popular. [And the internet agrees with me](https://www.thegamer.com/best-fishing-mini-games/)!

In this proposal I describe a fishing game that takes place on various planets with a wide array of alien fish. Most of these fish will not eat you and your boat without warning. (No promises.) (Maybe.)

## Sketch (In Words)

This fishing game is meant to be played to idle away time that might be better spent doing useful things. Ideally, players will fish for hours without realizing time has passed, and be relaxed, happy, and ready to tackle those real-life things that they should have been doing all along.

The game unfolds as follows:

1. A new level is drawn to the screen. Each level has:
  - A sky: it might have clouds, twinkling stars, a moon in the sky, etc.
  - Ground: The ground is a cross-section of lake banks and bottom
  - Water: The lake has water that fills up along the 'sides' of the ground
  - A boat: This always starts near the shore of the lake
  - A fisher: This is your player's avatar, and it starts in the boat
  - A bunch of fish under the water. They are visible to the player.
  - Each level has some set of Fish classes that will populate the lake.
  - The goal is to wait for a bite and raise the fish within some time limit
  - The environment can change as time passes: weather, day/night
  - Each fish you catch is worth points
2. Player's controls:
  - Keys A and D Move the boat along the surface of the lake
  - Key W will lower the fishing line if the boat is not moving 
  - Key S will lift the fishing line if the boat is not moving
  - Space Key can also be used to lift the fishing line right away
  - A second player controls might be possible so they can fish together
3. Fish behavior:
  - Each fish is slightly different from the others, both individually and by class
  - Each fish has several behaviors:
    * They can bite if they are near the hook at the end of the line.
    * When they bite they have some probability of getting caught on the hook.
    * They swim around at different speeds
    * They have preferences around which depth they swim
    * They must stay in the water unless they're caught on the hook
4. Debugging features:
  - It pays dividends to write graphical debugging layers, so I will do that.
  - I will overdo it on the debugging graphics so I can point out how useful it is.
  - Keyboard numbers 1â€“9 will toggle on and off debugging layers.

The gameplay is meant to be very simple and relaxing. Score is kept as a curiosity and is not the point, but it does afford me the opportunity to do something interesting with text.

## Software Approach

I will use classes to model several concepts:

- `Game`: The world game object is the top-level object that controls the others. It can remember the player's score from round to round, and is responsible for re-building the world on request.
- `World`: This models how the game's environment will change on every game play. The world picks random settings for the world components, such as the sky's colors and weather, the ground and water color, how long a day is, and it generates several world-specific kinds of fish.
- `Fisher`: This models the player's character (some sort of space-helmet thing) and the boat and maybe oars. 
- `FishingPole`: I will animate the fishing rod as the fisher casts their line and reels it up and down. 
- `Ground`: The ground just provides a place to put the water, and might have some visual appeal.
- `Water`: The lake has a bumpy bottom, and its exact shape will be randomly generated by placing a sequence of points with semi-random locations, and stringing them together as a Bezier curve. To help the fish stay in their tank, the water class will support collision detection.
- `Fish`: Several common types of fish will be made with either subclasses or by carefully implementing a common interface. When the world is created it will also create parameterizations for several more species of fish that will only be valid for that particular game.

## Graphic Approach

![Hand Sketch of Fishing In Space!](space_fishing_sketch.jpg)

The game's world fits in a single screen. I will draw several layers from back-to-front. 

In the back there will be the sky. It fills the upper half of the screen and can include color gradients as the alien planet's daylight changes, or weather patterns like clouds, and celestial objects like the sun, moon, and stars.

The ground is drawn on top of that and should be pretty simple, maybe a solid color, or maybe strata with some constrained color palette.

The fisher is drawn next, right above the lake. The boat will intersect with the water a little bit. I hope to animate the line being cast. The fishing rod is part of this rendering layer as well. The fishing line ends with a little hook.

The lake is drawn next, and covers up a good part of the ground. The top is flat, but the lake bottom will be bumpy. To make it different every time, the lake bed will be generated with randomness. I'll use a circle to define some points, and then jiggle them up and down by some amount. These points will define the control points of a multi-segment Bezier curve.

The fish are drawn next. They move around at random. Each fish uses distinct random numbers in a range determined by their species. Their colors and the like are also random based on species.

The Game UI is drawn last so that it appears on top. This will be very simple: keyboard hints and the current score.

## Timeline

+ 2 hours for building the sky, ground, lake, fisher+boat graphics
+ 2 hours for building the fish movement behavior
+ 1 hour for interactive things: moving the boat, casting the line, and reeling it in with a fish
+ 2 hours to write debugging graphics and polish it up for publication on Steam

This totals 7 hours estimated effort.
